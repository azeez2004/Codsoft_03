Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses logistic regression to predict survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset. The code begins by loading the dataset and performing initial preprocessing, including dropping irrelevant columns (Name, Ticket, Cabin), handling missing values in Age and Embarked, and converting categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numerical values using one-hot encoding. The dataset is then split into features (X) and the target variable (y), followed by a train-validation split with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for validation. A logistic regression model is trained with a maximum of 1000 iterations and evaluated on the validation set. The validation accuracy and a detailed classification report, including precision, recall, and F1-score, are printed to assess the model's performance. Ensure that you have pandas and scikit-learn installed in your environment to run this code.
